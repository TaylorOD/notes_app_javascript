## Notes App in JavaScript README:

### Notes App in JavaScript

- This is a simple web browser notes app that allows you to take notes, edit notes, update, and delete notes. 
- I wanted to practice my Vanilla JavaScript skills rather than using Vue or React with this project. 

### Technology stack: 
- This was build using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  
### Status:  
- I plan to make more updates to the project and to host it for easier use but it should be considered finished and usable.

### Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
Include any essential instructions for:
- Getting it: download or clone the project
- Running it: use live-server to open the index.html file

### Contributing

### Known issues
